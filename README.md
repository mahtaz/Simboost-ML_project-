# Simboost(ML_project)

## SimBoost

Drug discovery is a time-consuming, laborious, costly and high-risk process. According to a report by the Eastern Research Group (ERG), it usually takes 10-15 years to develop a new drug. However, the success rate of developing a new molecular entity is only 2.01%. \
Finding a compound that selectively binds to a particular protein is a highly challenging and typically expensive procedure in the drug development process. \
In this project we are going to implement [SimBoost](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5395521/#CR42) which is machine-learning approch for predicting drugâ€“target binding affinities using gradient boosting.
